  "content": "To all employees,\n\nPlease be informed of an upcoming change to the visitor registration procedure at our main office. This update is being implemented to enhance building security and improve the efficiency of the check-in process. The new procedure will take effect on July 1.\n\nUnder the updated system, all visitors must be registered in advance through the internal portal. Employees hosting visitors are responsible for submitting the visitor’s name, company affiliation, and expected arrival time at least one business day before the visit. Upon arrival, visitors will be required to present a valid photo ID at the reception desk and wear a temporary badge at all times while on the premises.\n\nFor last-minute visits, employees should contact the Security Office directly for approval. Please note that visitors who are not pre-registered may experience delays or be denied entry during peak hours.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in following these procedures to maintain a safe working environment. If you have any questions about the new registration process, please contact the Security Office.",
