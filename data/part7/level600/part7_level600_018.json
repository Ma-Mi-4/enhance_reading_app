  "content": "To all employees,\n\nPlease be advised of a temporary change to office entry hours during the first week of September. Due to scheduled maintenance on the building’s access control system, employees will only be able to enter the office between 8:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. from September 2 to September 6.\n\nDuring this period, early-morning and late-evening access will be restricted. Employees who normally work outside these hours are encouraged to adjust their schedules or consult with their managers in advance. Security staff will be on-site throughout the day to assist with entry-related issues.\n\nAll other office facilities and services will operate as usual. Once the maintenance work is completed, normal access hours will resume, and a follow-up announcement will be posted on the internal portal.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and cooperation.",
