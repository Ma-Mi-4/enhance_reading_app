  "category": "notice",
  "content": "To all employees,\n\nWe would like to inform you of a temporary closure of the company fitness center due to scheduled maintenance. Over the past few months, several machines have required repairs, and our maintenance team has recommended a full inspection to ensure the safety and comfort of all users. Because the inspection process involves moving heavy equipment and replacing several worn parts, the facility must remain closed during this period.\n\nThe fitness center will be unavailable from August 14 to August 18. During this time, contractors will perform safety checks on the treadmills, stationary bikes, and weight machines. Additionally, new flooring will be installed in the stretching area to improve shock absorption and reduce noise. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially for employees who use the fitness center during their lunch break.\n\nAs an alternative, employees are encouraged to use the temporary workout space set up in Meeting Room B on the second floor. This room will be equipped with yoga mats and resistance bands, and short stretching sessions will be offered twice a day by volunteer staff members. Please check the internal portal for the latest session schedule.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to improve our wellness facilities. If you have any questions about the maintenance schedule or the temporary workout area, please contact the Human Resources Department.",
