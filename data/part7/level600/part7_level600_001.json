Due to a client presentation, we will now meet on Friday at 2 p.m. in the main conference room. Please bring the updated sales report and any questions you might have regarding the new marketing strategy.\n\nAlso, I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether the design team will be able to join us remotely. Their feedback on the new product layout will be essential for our next step.\n\nBest regards,\nNaoko Suzuki\nProject Manager",
