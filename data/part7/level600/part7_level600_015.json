  "content": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nThis is a reminder that all employees are required to complete the Annual Compliance Training by June 15. The training covers key topics such as data protection, workplace ethics, and updated regulatory requirements. Completing this course is mandatory and helps ensure that our company continues to meet legal and industry standards.\n\nThe training is available through the online learning portal and can be completed at your convenience. Most participants finish the course in approximately 60 minutes. Once completed, your progress will be automatically recorded in the system, and no further action is needed.\n\nEmployees who have already completed the training this year may disregard this message. However, those who do not finish the course by the deadline may temporarily lose access to certain internal systems until the requirement is met.\n\nIf you experience technical issues accessing the training materials, please contact the IT Helpdesk. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.",
