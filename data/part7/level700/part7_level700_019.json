  "category": "notice",
  "content": "To all staff,\n\nThe Administration Department is pleased to announce the introduction of a new centralized office supply ordering system, which will be implemented starting September 10. This change is intended to streamline purchasing procedures, improve cost control, and reduce delays caused by inconsistent ordering practices across departments. By consolidating requests into a single platform, the company aims to improve efficiency and ensure better visibility of overall spending.\n\nUnder the new system, employees will be required to submit supply requests through the internal procurement portal rather than placing orders independently. Each department will be assigned a monthly spending limit, and requests exceeding this limit will require managerial approval. Routine items such as stationery and printer supplies can be ordered directly, while specialized equipment may require additional justification before approval is granted.\n\nTo support a smooth transition, training materials and step-by-step guides will be made available on the internal portal next week. Employees are encouraged to review these materials carefully before submitting their first request. During the initial rollout period, the Administration Team will monitor usage closely and provide assistance to address any issues that may arise.\n\nPlease note that urgent supply needs should still be communicated directly to your department manager, as emergency purchases may be handled outside the standard process. For questions regarding the new system or ordering procedures, contact the Administration Help Desk.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",
