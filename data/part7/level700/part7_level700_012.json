To ensure a smooth and well-organized event, please review the following participation guidelines carefully.\n\nAll exhibitors are required to complete booth setup between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on November 14. Early access will not be permitted due to venue regulations. Each booth must be staffed during official exhibition hours, and exhibitors are responsible for maintaining a clean and professional display throughout the event.\n\nExhibitors planning live product demonstrations must submit a demonstration schedule in advance for approval. Demonstrations involving sound equipment must comply with volume limits established by the venue. Any materials considered hazardous or prohibited under local safety regulations are strictly forbidden.\n\nAn on-site inspection will be conducted each morning before the exhibition opens to the public. Booths found in violation of the guidelines may be required to make immediate adjustments or suspend operations temporarily.\n\nA detailed floor map, setup instructions, and contact information for event staff will be provided via email one week prior to the exhibition.
