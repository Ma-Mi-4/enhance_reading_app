  "category": "notice",
  "content": "To all library patrons,\n\nWe would like to inform you of upcoming changes to the reservation system for the study rooms on the third floor of the Central Library. These adjustments have been made in response to recent feedback regarding long wait times and inconsistent availability, particularly during examination seasons. The goal of the new system is to ensure fairer access for all users.\n\nBeginning April 5, reservations will be limited to a maximum of two hours per person per day. Users will no longer be allowed to book multiple sessions under different names. Additionally, all reservations must now be made through the online portal, as the previous in-person sign-up sheets will be discontinued. The online system will automatically release study rooms if they are not checked into within ten minutes of the reserved time.\n\nTo help patrons transition smoothly, the library will offer brief demonstrations on how to use the new reservation system. These demonstrations will take place near the main entrance at 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. during the first week of April.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and hope these changes will improve access to the study rooms for all learners. Please contact the Information Desk if you have questions or concerns about the new reservation procedure.",
