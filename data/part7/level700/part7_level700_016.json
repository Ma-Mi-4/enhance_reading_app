  "category": "notice",
  "content": "To all staff members,\n\nThis notice is to inform you of upcoming changes to the company’s meeting room reservation system, which will take effect beginning September 1. These updates are intended to improve room availability, reduce scheduling conflicts, and ensure that shared spaces are used more efficiently across all departments.\n\nUnder the revised policy, meeting rooms must be reserved at least 24 hours in advance using the online booking platform. Same-day reservations will no longer be permitted, except in cases approved by a department manager. In addition, employees are required to cancel reservations promptly if a meeting is no longer needed, allowing other teams to use the space.\n\nTo address frequent no-shows, reservations that remain unused for more than 15 minutes past the scheduled start time will be automatically released. This measure is expected to increase access during peak hours, particularly for larger conference rooms that are often in high demand.\n\nThe updated system will also include a feature that allows organizers to specify equipment needs, such as video conferencing tools or presentation screens. Requests for specialized equipment should be submitted at least two business days before the meeting to ensure availability.\n\nA step-by-step guide explaining the new reservation procedures will be available on the internal portal later this month. Employees with questions or technical issues are encouraged to contact the Facilities Management Team for assistance.",
