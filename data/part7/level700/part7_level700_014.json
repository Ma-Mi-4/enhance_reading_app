  "category": "email",
  "content": "Dear Employees,\n\nWe would like to inform you about an upcoming upgrade to the company’s internal project management software, which is scheduled to take place on August 15. This upgrade is part of our ongoing efforts to improve system performance, enhance security, and introduce features that better support cross-department collaboration. The decision follows feedback collected earlier this year regarding system speed and usability issues.\n\nDuring the upgrade process, the system will be temporarily unavailable from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Employees who regularly work during late hours are advised to save their work in advance and avoid accessing the platform during this maintenance window. Once the upgrade is complete, users will notice a redesigned dashboard, improved search functionality, and expanded reporting tools.\n\nTo help employees adapt to the changes, short training sessions will be offered online starting the week after the upgrade. These sessions will cover key updates and provide tips on how to use the new features efficiently. Attendance is optional but strongly recommended, especially for team leaders who frequently manage shared projects.\n\nA detailed summary of the changes, along with a link to register for the training sessions, will be posted on the internal portal later this week. If you experience any issues after the upgrade or have questions in advance, please contact the IT Support Desk.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",
