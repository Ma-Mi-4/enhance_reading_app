  "content": "To all employees,\n\nWe would like to notify you that the office water dispensers will undergo routine maintenance this Friday. The maintenance team will check the filters, sanitize the machines, and ensure that all units are functioning properly. This work is part of our regular effort to provide clean and safe drinking water for everyone.\n\nDuring maintenance hours, some dispensers may be temporarily unavailable. Signs will be posted on machines that cannot be used. Employees are encouraged to refill their bottles earlier in the day or use the dispensers located on other floors if necessary.\n\nThe maintenance is scheduled to take place between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on all floors. Please note that the work may cause brief interruptions, but the team will try to minimize any inconvenience.\n\nIf you notice any issues with a dispenser after the maintenance has been completed, please report it to the Facilities Department at facilities@cleanwater.com.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n",
