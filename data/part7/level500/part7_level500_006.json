The session will take place in Meeting Room 2 on the third floor and will begin promptly at 10:00 a.m. All staff members are encouraged to attend, especially those who joined the company within the last six months.\n\nThe training will cover basic workplace safety procedures, including emergency exits, fire extinguisher locations, and guidelines for reporting safety hazards. There will also be a short demonstration on how to use the new attendance tracking system that was introduced earlier this month.\n\nPlease bring a notebook or laptop if you would like to take notes. Light refreshments such as water, tea, and cookies will be provided. If you are unable to attend due to a schedule conflict, please inform your supervisor by Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and look forward to seeing you at the session.\n",
