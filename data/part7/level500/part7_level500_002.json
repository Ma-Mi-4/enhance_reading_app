  "content": "To all employees,\n\nWe would like to inform you about an update to our office visitor policy, which will take effect next Monday. Due to an increase in the number of external guests visiting our company, the security team has introduced new procedures to help ensure a safe and organized environment.\n\nAll employees who expect a visitor must register the guest in advance using the Visitor Registration Page on the company portal. After completing the registration, you will receive a confirmation email that includes a temporary visitor pass. Please forward this pass to your guest before their arrival.\n\nWhen visitors arrive at the reception desk, they should present the pass either on their mobile device or as a printed copy. The receptionist will then provide them with an access badge that allows entry to the designated meeting area. Visitors are not allowed to move freely around the office without an escort from an employee.\n\nPlease note that same-day registrations are still accepted; however, processing may take additional time during busy hours. To avoid delays, we recommend submitting visitor information as early as possible.\n\nIf you have questions about the updated policy or encounter issues with the registration system, please contact the Security Office at security@office-safe.com.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n",
