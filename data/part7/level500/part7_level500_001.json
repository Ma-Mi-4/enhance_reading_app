  "content": "Dear Team,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I would like to share an update regarding our office maintenance request system. Starting next Monday, all maintenance-related issues such as broken chairs, flickering lights, or malfunctioning air conditioners should be submitted through the new online request form. This form will replace the previous system where employees contacted the Facilities Department directly by email.\n\nThe new form can be accessed through the company portal under the “Support” section. When submitting a request, please include a brief description of the issue, your office location, and the urgency level. Once your request is submitted, you will receive a confirmation email with a tracking number. This will allow you to monitor the progress of your request and see when the repair will be completed.\n\nAdditionally, please remember that non-urgent issues may take up to three business days to resolve, depending on technician availability. If you experience an urgent issue that affects your ability to work, such as a power outage in your area, please inform your supervisor immediately before submitting the form.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation as we transition to this updated system. If you have questions or encounter technical problems with the form, feel free to contact the IT Help Desk for assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nOffice Management Team",
