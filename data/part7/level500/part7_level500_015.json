  "content": "To all employees,\n\nWe would like to inform you about an upcoming office renovation that will begin next Monday and continue for approximately three weeks. The purpose of this renovation is to improve the working environment by upgrading lighting, replacing old carpeting, and reorganizing shared workspaces. These changes are part of the company’s ongoing effort to create a more comfortable and efficient office.\n\nDuring the renovation period, some areas on the second and third floors will be temporarily closed. Employees who usually work in these areas will be relocated to available desks on other floors. A detailed seating plan will be sent by email before the renovation begins. Please follow the instructions carefully to avoid confusion.\n\nConstruction work will take place between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. every weekday. While the renovation team will try to keep noise to a minimum, some disruption may be unavoidable. Employees are encouraged to use meeting rooms or remote work options when concentration is required.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding the renovation or temporary seating arrangements, please contact the Administration Office by Friday. We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this period.",
