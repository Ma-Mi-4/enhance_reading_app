To ensure that materials are delivered on time and that costs are managed efficiently, all supply requests must follow the standard ordering process.\n\nEmployees who need office supplies such as paper, pens, or folders should submit a request form through the internal ordering system. The form must be completed with accurate item names, quantities, and the required delivery date. Incomplete forms may result in delays.\n\nAll requests are reviewed by the Administration Team every Wednesday. Approved orders will be placed with our supplier on Thursday, and delivery is usually completed within three business days. Please plan ahead when requesting items needed for meetings or projects.\n\nIf you urgently require supplies due to unexpected circumstances, please contact the Administration Team directly. However, urgent requests should be limited to essential items only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in helping us maintain an efficient ordering system.",
