The maintenance work will include repainting parking lines, repairing uneven pavement sections, and improving overall lighting in the area to enhance safety for all employees and visitors.\n\nThe parking lot will be closed from Saturday at 8:00 a.m. until Sunday at 6:00 p.m. During this time, employees are asked to use the temporary parking area located behind the East Building. Signs will be posted around the office to guide drivers to the correct location.\n\nPlease remember to move your vehicles from the main parking lot before 8:00 a.m. on Saturday. Any cars left in the lot after this time may need to be towed to avoid delaying the maintenance schedule.\n\nIf you have questions or require special accommodations, please contact the Facilities Team at facilities@workplace.com.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n",
