  "content": "Dear Employees,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that new recycling bins have been installed throughout the office building. This update is part of our ongoing effort to promote environmentally friendly practices and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.\n\nThe new bins are located in common areas such as break rooms, hallways, and near the elevators on each floor. Each bin is clearly labeled for paper, plastic, and metal items. Please make sure to place your items in the correct bin to help ensure that materials can be properly processed and reused.\n\nIn addition to the new bins, educational posters have been placed around the office to remind everyone of proper recycling habits. These posters include examples of what can and cannot be recycled. If you are unsure whether an item is recyclable, please check the poster or ask a member of the Facilities Team for guidance.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in helping us create a more sustainable workplace. Should you have suggestions for additional environmental initiatives, feel free to contact us at eco-office@company.com.\n",
