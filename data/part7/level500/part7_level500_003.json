Starting next Monday, all employees will receive a 15 percent discount on selected menu items during weekday lunch hours. This offer was created in partnership with the building management team to support healthier and more convenient meal options for employees.\n\nThe discount applies to sandwiches, salads, and the daily lunch special. To receive the discount, simply show your employee ID card at the register before making your payment. Please note that the offer is not valid for beverages, desserts, or items ordered through delivery services.\n\nSunlight Café has also added several new vegetarian and low-calorie options to its menu. These items will be clearly marked with a green leaf icon. The café hopes that these additions will make it easier for employees to enjoy nutritious meals during busy workdays.\n\nIf you have any questions about the discount program or would like to suggest additional menu items, feel free to contact the café manager at info@sunlightcafe.com.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this special offer and look forward to serving you soon!\n",
